Blocks (cut into cards and shuffle)
---------------------------------
(Note: some blocks may be distractors.)

[B1] Introduce a helper constant equal to the chosen multiplier.
[B2] Replace the numeric multiplier in the goal with the helper constant.
[B3] Rewrite the comparison to use the explicit formula for the reference function.
[B4] Convert the lower bound on n into a real-number inequality.
[B5] Record that the squared term is nonnegative under the domain assumption.
[B6] Bound the linear term by a quadratic term using n ≥ 1.
[B7] Bound the constant term by a quadratic term using n ≥ 1.
[B8] Combine the bounds to show f(n) is at most a fixed multiple of n^2.
[B9] Show that the intermediate multiple is at most the chosen multiplier.
[B10] Chain the two inequalities to finish the required upper bound.
[D1] Rewrite using the helper equality in the opposite direction.
[D2] Try to strengthen the domain to a larger lower bound.
