Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no commentary). Generate exactly ONE Parsons puzzle about Big-O time complexity.

We will verify with Lean using:
BigO (f g : ℕ → ℝ) : Prop := ∃ c > 0, ∃ n0 : ℕ, ∀ n ≥ n0, f n ≤ c * g n

STRICT "Lean reliability" constraints:
- Use ONLY a quadratic polynomial example:
  f(n) = a*n^2 + b*n + d with a,b,d being nonnegative integers (1..20).
  g(n) = n^2.
- Set constants.n0 = 1 ALWAYS.
- Choose constants.c as a specific integer that is clearly ≥ a+b+d (e.g., a+b+d+5).
- All English blocks must reference the concrete numbers (a,b,d,c,n0). Do NOT write “some constant” or “a constant”.
- Each block must be atomic: one step only.
- Provide 8–12 blocks total with 2–3 distractors.
- Every block MUST include:
  - "text": plain English math step (NO Lean words like simp/nlinarith/exact_mod_cast)
  - "lean": Lean tactic snippet valid after `intro n hn`
- The Lean proof must use these exact names somewhere:
  - hn'   : (1:ℝ) ≤ (n:ℝ)
  - hsq   : (n:ℝ) ≤ ((n:ℝ)^2)
  - h1sq  : (1:ℝ) ≤ ((n:ℝ)^2)
  - hsum  : (a*n^2 + b*n + d) ≤ (A:ℝ) * (n^2)   (A is a specific integer you choose)
  - hbound: (A:ℝ) * (n^2) ≤ (c:ℝ) * (n^2)
- The final proof step MUST be EXACTLY:
  exact le_trans hsum hbound

Also REQUIRED: include a block that unfolds the goal at the start:
  Lean snippet: `simp [Parsons.f, Parsons.g]`
  English text: “Unfold f and g so the goal is an explicit inequality in n.”

Notes for Lean snippets (must follow):
- Convert hn : n ≥ 1 to real inequality using:
  `have hn' : (1:ℝ) ≤ (n:ℝ) := by exact_mod_cast hn`
- Use nlinarith only on polynomial inequalities.
- Use nonneg fact for n^2 as:
  `have hn2nonneg : (0:ℝ) ≤ ((n:ℝ)^2) := by exact sq_nonneg (n:ℝ)`
- Ensure the final goal is solved only at the very last block (the le_trans line).

English block formatting rule (IMPORTANT):
- Do NOT repeat the parameter list (a,b,d,c,n0) in every block.
- Mention the concrete values ONLY ONCE in problem.f_text/problem.g_text/domain_text OR as a single "given" sentence in the first block.
- Every other block should be short and contextual, e.g.:
  "From n ≥ 1, rewrite it as 1 ≤ n (in ℝ)."
  "Using 1 ≤ n, conclude n ≤ n^2."
  "Bound 9n by 9n^2 using n ≤ n^2."
- The block text may still include specific numbers when they matter (like 9n ≤ 9n^2, A=28, c=33),
  but must not repeat the full tuple “a=…, b=…, d=…, c=…, n0=…”.
