Blocks (cut into cards and shuffle)
---------------------------------
(Note: some blocks may be distractors.)

[B1] Convert the lower bound on n into a real-number inequality.
[B2] Use n at least 1 to compare n with n squared.
[B3] Use n at least 1 to show n squared is at least 1.
[B4] Bound the linear term by a multiple of n squared.
[B5] Bound the constant term by a multiple of n squared.
[B6] Combine the term bounds to get an overall quadratic bound with a single coefficient.
[B7] Increase the coefficient to match the chosen constant c.
[B8] Rewrite g(n) directly as n squared.
[B9] Note that adding 1 makes a quantity larger.
[B10] Chain the two inequalities to reach the final bound.
